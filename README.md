1) Place the four legs down where the corners of the bed will be. Make sure the three taller bits on the top are on the outside edged of the frame. The smaller leg will allow the mats to sit flush with the frame in the final assembly so must be closest to the center of the bed.

2) Use the long side rails to position the legs the right distance apart. Place the long rails into the slots in the legs. The side rails are identical so it doesn't matter which side they go. The ledge with dowel holes should be facing inwards, as in the picture.

3) Lay the top and bottom rails at the top and bottom, and place the center rail inbetween. Note the top of the center rail has holes for dowels at either end, the bottom of the center rail has dowel holes in the middle for the support leg.

4) Put two dowels in either end of the center rail.

5) Put one of the round nuts into the hole in the center rail. Try to line up the hole through the nut so it will line up with the bolt.

6) Push the center rail into the top or bottom rail, and bolt together using the bolt and allen key. Use a screwdriver to turn the nut around if it doesn't line up with the bolt.

7) Repeat for the the other end so the top and bottom rails are both bolted to the center rail. This forms what looks like an I, viewed from the top or bottom, or an H viewed from the side.

8) The center rail also needs the short support leg bolted to the underside. I've done this by tipping this up to the side so it looks like an H stood up. This is easier with two people. Use two dowels and a nut and bolt, the same way as the center rail bolted to each end of the outer frame.

9) With one person at each end, bring the frame down and place into each leg. This can be a bit fiddly to get all the legs in exactly the right place so the frame slots together. Try and align one side rail in the exact place where you want the bed frame to be positioned. Because of the way the frame slots together, it is not easy to move once completely assembled. Once this is done you're nearly there.

10) If you want to move the frame into final position, now is the time to do this. 
 
11) Place the rest of the dowels into the holes in the center rail and along the side rails. There are two extra holes in the side rails which don't have holes in the center rail. 

12) Take one of the stacks of slats, place one end between the dowels and the top rail, and extend the stack down so the final slat at the other end is between the dowels and the other end of the bed. There will be an extra wide space in the middle of the stack.

13) Take the long rail and place it across the middle. Each end should line up with a dowel in the side rails.

14) Place the mats on the frame, and you're finally done.
